# Trivia Game
**Created by Leah Irwin**

## Allows you to pick between two categories, Skyrim or Harry Potter, to test your knowledge in a round of 10 randomized questions from a question bank. I enjoy the game Skyrim and the story of Harry Potter and wanted to challenge myself to random facts and tibits about each, so I created this trivia game.
